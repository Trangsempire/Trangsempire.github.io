      <description>When you step in the restaurant, it&amp;rsquo;s like entering a whole new world (believe me, you can&amp;rsquo;t tell from outside). The decor screams romantic and modern asian fusion. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect place to bring in your date or a family gathering.
KyomiTartare I ordered the Salmon Tartare (meal version comes with sweet potatoes so why not?! :D) AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS HEAVEN. It&amp;rsquo;s sweet and light, the asian inspiration crispy crackers go very well with this tartare.</description>

      <description>When I heard about this new ramen place in town, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier. Because more ramen is always good.
Kumamoto Ramen What&amp;rsquo;s cool about this new restaurant is the isolation booth concept. You have these wood panels separating you and you neighbors. You have a little button for ordering food and an autorefill water system.Then you receive your bowl of ramen through a curtain covered window.</description>

      <description>Once you enter the place, you will notice the coziness of the entrance. However, it’s only an illusion since they have more seats behind.
ComptoirComptoir I ordered a Margherita Pizza (9$) and my boyfriend got the Italian Sausage (13$). The crust was perfect, not too dry, a little chewy and soft in the center. Tomato sauce was okay but what really amazes me was … THE CHEESE, miam!</description>
