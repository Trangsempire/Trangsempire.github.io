      <description>Hello everyone!
This post is little different. It&amp;rsquo;s not a review of a restaurant or cafe, but a book. But hey, it&amp;rsquo;s still related to food! I received my first cookbook ever for holidays and it&amp;rsquo;s Kim Thúy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Le secret des vietnamiennes&amp;rdquo;.
If you have read Kim Thúy&amp;rsquo;s books, you must have noticed the simple and beautiful writing style. There is also something delicate about it.
The simplicity and delicacy are still very present in the cook book.</description>

      <description>Monopole is a coffee shop, restaurant and {bar in the Cité du Multimédia, a neighbourhood consisting mostly of tech companies. It has been open since May 12th.
It has a nice selection of pastries and serves coffee from 49th Parallel and Bows and Arrows. It has quickly become my go-to coffee shop for commuting to work between Old Montreal and Griffintown. Lunch and dinner menus are also available with good quality food for reasonable prices.</description>
