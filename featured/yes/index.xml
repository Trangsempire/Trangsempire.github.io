      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you can tell already but I&amp;rsquo;m a die hard fan of ramen. Like ANY type of ramen. I love them all &amp;lt;3 It&amp;rsquo;s always been my favourite thing when I learn about a new ramen restaurant opening in Montreal. But from all the dozens of restaurants I tried, nothing beats the ramen from Yokato Yokabai.
This will be a very big statement but I think this is the BEST ramen restaurant so far.</description>

      <description>For this special post, I’ve asked my co-bloggers to list me all their top coffee places to study and I’ve assembled the ones that was in common on our lists.
Legend: &amp;hearts; = the bloggers’ favourites
1. La Finca Coffee &amp;amp; Office | &amp;hearts; Laura
| &amp;hearts; Trang
| ADDRESS: 1067 Rue de Bleury, Montréal, QC H2Z 1N1 | Métro Place D’Armes
La Finca   A favourite of mine because of the accessibility by metro, the coziness of the place and the instagrammy worth of everyshot and every angle!</description>

      <description>In the past years, I’ve had my fair share of following the trend of the #MTLCafeCrawl. After much exploring (and many cups of coffee in my system), I can definitely say that the Café Sfouf has become one of my all-time favorite cafes in Montreal.
Cafe Sfouf   When I first stumbled across this cute little spot in the Gay Village, I was drawn to its vintage exterior and the welcoming atmosphere that it exuded.</description>

      <description>Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at Guy Concordia or Peel and I (a petit poussin) find myself searching for a coffee shop, this one is the first to pop in my head. Very accessible by metro, it only took me 5 mins to walk to Crescent St and find this little jewel. I love the decor, immediately the combination of the green from the plants and the white modern look caught my eyes.</description>
