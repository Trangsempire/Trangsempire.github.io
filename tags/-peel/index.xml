      <description>Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at Guy Concordia or Peel and I (a petit poussin) find myself searching for a coffee shop, this one is the first to pop in my head. Very accessible by metro, it only took me 5 mins to walk to Crescent St and find this little jewel. I love the decor, immediately the combination of the green from the plants and the white modern look caught my eyes.</description>

Comptoir  Comptoir     I ordered a Margherita Pizza (9$) and my boyfriend got the Italian Sausage (13$). The crust was perfect, not too dry, a little chewy and soft in the center. Tomato sauce was okay but what really amazes me was … THE CHEESE, miam!</description>
