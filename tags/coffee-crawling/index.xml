      <description>Regine Cafe   The Gaufré This place is by far, my favorite brunch spot for numerous reasons. First of all, the menu offers many interesting and creative choices, such as Scottish eggs, brioche bread, pulled ham, trout gravlax and mascarpone cheese cream. Even their oatmeal, made with coconut milk and mango jam, tastes spectacular. Every bite is heaven and the presentation is gorgeous. For those who are gluten intolerance, they offer a few gluten-free options.</description>

      <description>As you enter The Mile End, one of the hippest areas in Montreal, you’ll come across a quaint little brunch spot called Le Café Melbourne. First, you’ll notice a sign reading &amp;ldquo;Our French is not good, but our coffee is”, flash a grin, enter the café, and be greeted with the warm smiles of the Australian owner and his staff. Take a seat, and get ready for some Insta-worthy moments.</description>

      <description>For this special post, I’ve asked my co-bloggers to list me all their top coffee places to study and I’ve assembled the ones that was in common on our lists.

      <description>In the past years, I’ve had my fair share of following the trend of the #MTLCafeCrawl. After much exploring (and many cups of coffee in my system), I can definitely say that the Café Sfouf has become one of my all-time favorite cafes in Montreal.
Cafe Sfouf   When I first stumbled across this cute little spot in the Gay Village, I was drawn to its vintage exterior and the welcoming atmosphere that it exuded.</description>

      <description>Monopole is a coffee shop, restaurant and {bar in the Cité du Multimédia, a neighbourhood consisting mostly of tech companies. It has been open since May 12th.
It has a nice selection of pastries and serves coffee from 49th Parallel and Bows and Arrows. It has quickly become my go-to coffee shop for commuting to work between Old Montreal and Griffintown. Lunch and dinner menus are also available with good quality food for reasonable prices.</description>

      <description>Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at Guy Concordia or Peel and I (a petit poussin) find myself searching for a coffee shop, this one is the first to pop in my head. Very accessible by metro, it only took me 5 mins to walk to Crescent St and find this little jewel. I love the decor, immediately the combination of the green from the plants and the white modern look caught my eyes.</description>

      <description>1. The Classiest Spot in Town Yes, you read it right. The classiest. Crew Collective Café is one of the most eye-candy coffee shop in our city, a main tourist attraction too. The building was once a bank and now they use the beautiful building design to turn it into a coffee shop and now also a lounge club (La Voute).
Crew Cafe Interior   2. The Neighborhood and Accessibility Situated in the heart of the most elegant neighborhood in town, close to Metro Square Victoria (2 mins walk) and in front of te World Trade Center Montreal.</description>
